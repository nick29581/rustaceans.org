    "notes": "### Summary\n\nFormer farm, produce, and dairy worker turned lover of computer science. I began studying programming while working on a cow and goat dairy, 84 hours per week.\n\nStudying has always been a passion of mine; from equine behavior and Sanskrit, as a teenager, to holistic land management, accounting, Afro-based dance, and computer science, as an adult.\n\n### Long-term Vision\n\nI want to use my programming skills to benefit sustainable agriculture, specifically in the application of holistic management."
